# TevoTarantulaProFirmware
The entire code in this master branch is the original codes written or modified by Tevo for Tarantula Pro. I will keep this master branch as much as possible updated everytime Tevo releases a new firmware for Tarantula Pro. You can also visit the actual branch for Tarantula Pro in Tevo repositories. https://github.com/tevo3d/Tarantula-pro

# BUGS
If you're planning to fix some bugs, let's keep in mind to always create an issue, create separate branch, test it thoroughly, make a PR in *staging* branch.

# FEATURES
If you're planning to have a new feature, same with *BUGS*, create a new issue, and tell us why you need this feature for everyone to understand why the community need it.
